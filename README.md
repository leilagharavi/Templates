# Templates for different documents

## YYYYMMDD_Report 
This is the template I use during my PhD for activity reports before weekly  meetings with my daily supervisor.

* _YYYYMMDD_ is the format I use to indicate the report date.
* Everytime you run it, it generates a random color that is assigned to the title, textboxes or lines.
